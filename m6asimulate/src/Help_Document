To use:
	<-g	genome.fa>	provide reference genome sequence file.
	<-r	gencode.vcf>	provide reference genome annotation file. (e.g. gencode.v25.annotation.gtf)
	<-p	peak.bed>	provide peak positions, create file to store simulate peaks randomly generated if the file does not exist.
	<-m	snp.bed>	provide mutation positions, create file to store simulate mutations randomly generated if the file does not exist.
	<-ip	path/out_prefix>	file to store simulated IP fastq.
	<-in	path/out_prefix>	file to store simulated Input fastq.
	[-bn	int]	Background number for simulation. (must > 0) (10 default)
	[-en	float]	Peak enrichment number for simulation. (must >= 0) (15 default)
	[-sl	int]	Segment length in pair_end simulation, single-end mode enable when no greater than read length. (200 ~ 450 recommend) (350 default)
	[-rl	int]	Read length in simulation. (must > 0, 150 recommend) (150 default)
	[-mrl	int]	Minimum read length in simulation. (must > 0) (5 default)
	[-rs	int]	Random segment size in simulation. Therefore, simulated sequence length between read length ¡À random segment size.
	[-mp	float]	Proportion of mutation reads provided. (must ¡Ý 0.0 and ¡Ü 1.0) (0.5 default)
	[-q	string]	Qualities of bases simulated from this.
